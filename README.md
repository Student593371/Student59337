Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Final Project 

This repository was created by Student59337 (name omitted for privacy) for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera final project. It has instructions on how to run the analysis using the Human Activity recognition dataset. 

Dataset: 

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: link = http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Dataset for the project can be found in the following Zip file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files in this Repository: 

CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformation that are completed as a part of the cleaning the data. 
run_analysis.R - provides the code need to complete data cleaning for the data set following the steps outlined by the project. The steps that are included are: 
    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData_Output.txt - is the exported final clean data after the code above
