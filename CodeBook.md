Getting_and_Cleaning_Data Final Project 
Overview of run_analysis.R Script
The run_analysis.R script is responsible for preparing the dataset and executing five key steps as outlined in the course project requirements.

Step 1: Download and Extract the Dataset
The dataset is first downloaded and unzipped into a directory named UCI HAR Dataset

Step 2: Load Data into R
Each component of the dataset is read and stored in appropriate variables:

features <- features.txt
Contains 561 rows and 2 columns, detailing the features derived from 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data (tAcc-XYZ, tGyro-XYZ).
activities <- activity_labels.txt
Includes 6 rows and 2 columns with descriptive activity names and their corresponding codes.
Test Data:
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt: 2947 rows, identifies the test subjects (9 out of 30 volunteers).
x_test <- test/X_test.txt: 2947 rows, 561 columns of test set features.
y_test <- test/y_test.txt: 2947 rows, contains activity labels for the test set.
Training Data:
subject_train <- train/subject_train.txt: 7352 rows from 21 subjects.
x_train <- train/X_train.txt: 7352 rows, 561 columns of training set features.
y_train <- train/y_train.txt: 7352 rows of activity labels.

Step 3: Combine Training and Test Data
The script merges training and test datasets into one consolidated dataset:

X: Combined features data (x_train + x_test) resulting in 10299 rows, 561 columns.
Y: Combined activity labels (y_train + y_test) with 10299 rows.
Subject: Merged subject identifiers from both sets.
These are merged into a single dataset Merged_Data with 10299 rows and 563 columns using cbind().

Step 4: Extract Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements
A new subset called TidyData is created from Merged_Data, containing only columns related to mean and standard deviation along with subject and activity codes. This results in a dataset with 10299 rows and 88 columns.

Step 5: Apply Descriptive Activity Names
The activity codes in the code column are replaced with the corresponding activity names from the activities dataset, making the data more readable.

Step 6: Label Variables with Descriptive Names
The script enhances clarity by renaming variable labels:

"Acc" ➝ "Accelerometer"
"Gyro" ➝ "Gyroscope"
"BodyBody" ➝ "Body"
"Mag" ➝ "Magnitude"
Prefix "t" ➝ "Time"
Prefix "f" ➝ "Frequency"
Also, the code column is renamed to activity.

Step 7: Create Final Tidy Dataset
A final tidy dataset named FinalData is generated by grouping TidyData by subject and activity and calculating the average of each variable. This results in a clean dataset with 180 rows and 88 columns.

The tidy dataset is then written to a file named FinalData.txt.
